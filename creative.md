# The Artistic Soul

Art has been my companion through transformation—sometimes the only language adequate for what can't be spoken directly.

## Poetry

Words arranged in patterns that hopefully resonate, drawn from the deep well of experience. Some pieces live openly here, others reward the dedicated explorer.

## Visual Art

Expression through color, form, and texture. Digital experiments, traditional media, and whatever emerges from the intersection of creativity and healing.

## Performances

When the spirit moves me, I share work in person—readings, music, collaborative pieces. These ephemeral moments create unique connections between artist and audience.

## The Hidden Gallery

*Some art requires intentional seeking. Follow the threads, solve the puzzles, discover what lies beneath the surface.*
