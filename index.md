My name is Alida. If you've somehow found this site, you're welcome to poke around, although it is heavily under construction.  

All the below text was Claude-Code-Generated & will likely not remain as-is for very long, but I am appreciative of my coding companion, so it's staying for now :)

## Professionally
I'm a biologist-turned-programmer, drawn to the elegance of systems—whether cellular mechanisms or clean code. My foundation in evidence-based thinking keeps me grounded while navigating complexity. I build things that matter, solve problems that need solving, and approach technical challenges with both rigor and creativity.

## Personally  
I believe in the power of authentic connection and the courage it takes to be vulnerable. My path has been unconventional, marked by deep learning through experience rather than textbooks. I've learned that joy and groundedness are possible even after—especially after—walking through difficult terrain.

## What You'll Find Here
This site is designed for exploration at whatever depth feels right for you:

- **Surface level**: My technical projects, creative work, and upcoming events
- **Deeper waters**: Personal stories, reflections, and resources for those on similar journeys
- **Hidden treasures**: For the curious souls willing to solve puzzles and follow threads

I'm working on an app, writing poetry, performing when the spirit moves me, and always seeking authentic connection with fellow travelers.
