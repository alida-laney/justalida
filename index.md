Hey there! My name is Alida.

This is my little corner of the internet, made for sharing things I want to share.

Please feel free to poke around :)

## What You'll Find Here
This site is designed as a centralized place to send folks if they want to learn more about me.

I am a woman of diversity, so there are a variety of things you might encounter as I become more confident sharing.

Some examples:
- **Poetry** 
- **Visual Art**
- Music
- Performances/Talks
- Opinionated Ramblings


## Professional History
My resume scarcely reflects all my capabilities, but it is worth detailing as a glimpse into the way I seem to meander through life. Find a narrative retelling of it [here](/2025/09/22/resume/)


## Personally  
I believe in the power of authentic connection and the courage it takes to be vulnerable. My path has been unconventional, marked by deep learning through experience rather than textbooks. I've learned that joy and groundedness are possible even after—especially after—walking through difficult terrain.
