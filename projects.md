# Things I'm Building

## Current Work

### The App (Working Title)
*In development - coming soon*

A passion project born from personal experience and technical curiosity. Details will emerge as it takes shape, but I can say it sits at the intersection of healing and technology.

*Status: In active development*

## Technical Experiments

This space will grow with experiments, tools, and solutions I've built. From data pipelines to creative coding, from biological modeling to user experiences that matter.

### Code & Contributions
- This website itself: [Jekyll + GitHub Pages](https://github.com/alidahartwell/justalida)
- Other projects live in various repositories, emerging as they're ready to meet the world

## Past & Future

My background spans wet lab research, computational biology, and software engineering. Each project teaches me something new about building systems that serve life—whether code, communities, or personal growth.

*What would you like to see built? I'm always curious about problems worth solving.*
