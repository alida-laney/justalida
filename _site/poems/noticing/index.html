  <div class="poem-content">
    <p><u>Noticing</u></p>

<p>It is the first and most challenging step in learning to feel your feelings.<br />
How ironic it is that we’ve unlearned how to <em>feel</em> a <em>feeling.</em></p>

<p>I notice that thought.</p>

<p>It draws attention to itself in the most covert way.<br />
This poem was meant to be about joy.<br />
I sat down to notice my joy and experience it in the moment.<br />
Instead, I was met with a paradox</p>

<p><u>Intellectualizing</u></p>

<p>What is it to intellectualize an emotion?<br />
I think to myself,<br />
As I tuck my joy away<br />
In favor of noticing that thought</p>

<p>I sit with it,<br />
the <em>feeling</em> of <em>noticing</em>,<br />
now far removed<br />
from the joy I sat down to embrace</p>

<p><u>Sitting</u></p>

<p>Therapists say to “sit with your emotions”<br />
And so I do that,<br />
But sitting does not put my mind to rest.<br />
How can I tell my brain to rest?</p>

<p>How can I say to her,<br />
When she so clearly knows,<br />
As, here I am, having this thought,<br />
That she needs to sit and rest?</p>

<p><u>Rest</u></p>

<p>And it suddenly occurs to me,<br />
I cannot <em>tell</em> her to rest.<br />
<em>She</em> is <em>me</em><br />
And me is noticing her noticing me noticing her noticing noticing noticing</p>

<p><u>Feeling</u> is not noticing<br />
It is not labeling or speaking about or thinking about -<br />
It is<br />
<em>feeling</em></p>

<p>Breathing into the hug of tightness in my chest when it wants to burst with joy<br />
Leaning into the warmth of the butterflies in my tummy that remind me of times when I could not breathe</p>

<p>And I feel them relax</p>

<p>When they realize <br />
I am breathing</p>

<p>The muscles in my body are tense and tender<br />
From years of them feeling what I could not.<br />
But I am my body and she is me<br />
<em>She</em> was feeling it this whole time</p>

<p>We feel a sigh escape our lips<br />
and the hug in my chest turns to a tight grip.<br />
How unfortunate it is that I-</p>

<p>The suffocation yields to softness</p>

<p>how beautiful it is<br />
that I get to experience something so</p>

<p>human,</p>

<p>so innate,</p>

<p>on such an intimate level</p>
