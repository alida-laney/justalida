  <h1>Delight</h1>

  <div class="poem-content">
    <p>I am greatly pleased today.<br />
Not all days hold such tangible moments of alignment.</p>

<p>As worried as I am,<br />
I am ready.</p>

<p>Next steps aren’t to be planned or organized or orchestrated,<br />
Not by me, at least.</p>

<p>I am simply a feather,<br />
Dropped by a passing bird,<br />
Caught by the gentle breeze,<br />
Intersecting briefly with the leaf of a tree, then<br />
Floating,<br />
Swaying,<br />
Settling<br />
Down,<br />
Finding my resting place on the ground,<br />
Where I may be found,<br />
By a pen-maker,<br />
Who can turn my body into a tool,<br />
And use me with delight<br />
For years to come.</p>

<p>Does the feather,<br />
As it is floating gently down,<br />
Know of the whole journey to come?</p>

<p>It is not worth debating, because<br />
The journey will be, regardless.</p>

<p>My soul knows it is here for a purpose;<br />
I am delighted, today, to be dipping my toes<br />
Into the river that flows<br />
towards the ocean<br />
of my influence.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>
