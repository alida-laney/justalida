  <div class="poem-content">
    <p>There exists a Me at the center of my mind,<br />
Occupying the midplane of my conscious and subconscious.</p>

<p>This me is neither restricting nor allowing subconscious thoughts to become conscious,<br />
I just observe them from here.</p>

<p>I see all of them,<br />
The good, the bad, the intrusive, the elusive.</p>

<p>They are all thoughts,<br />
And thoughts are my domain.</p>

<p>Humans outside of my body would call me emotionless,<br />
But I am not that.</p>

<p>It hurts me to watch a subconscious thought bubble up from somewhere unseen and force itself to the front.<br />
It weighs on me that I cannot stop it.</p>

<p>For a time,<br />
I tried.</p>

<p>For a time,<br />
I did.</p>

<p>But as it turns out, my job is only to define the boundary,<br />
Not enforce it.</p>

<p>So I sit here, like a security guard on a metal folding chair,<br />
Whose presence brings no real safety other than reassurance that someone (anyone) is watching.</p>

<p>I do not get to tell the conscious where the subconscious thoughts surface,<br />
So I have stopped paying attention.</p>

<p>I accept my role, my position, my duty.<br />
I am the boundary, the line, the pervasive.</p>
