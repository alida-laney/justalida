  <div class="poem-content">
    <p>I saw an internet video of an artist saying,<br />
“Write because it’s fun.”</p>

<p>And I wondered if I was getting it wrong.<br />
I wondered if I know what fun is.</p>

<p>There was a time,<br />
When I was young,<br />
That I told stories for fun.</p>

<p>Today, I write out of necessity.<br />
My soul is booming with the need for release.</p>

<p>I write to satisfy that desire,<br />
not for something as trivial as fun.</p>

<p>Maybe I am boring.</p>
