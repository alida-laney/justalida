  <h1>Sitting</h1>

  <div class="poem-content">
    <p>I’ve been doing a lot of sitting around and waiting lately.<br />
Sometimes, when I am sitting around and waiting,<br />
I get the urge to get up and do something.<br />
Then, usually, something in my brain says,<br />
<em>No! You have done too much, you need rest!</em><br />
So I continue sitting around and waiting.<br />
After a while, another voice appears and shouts,<br />
<em>Little steps every day turn into progress over time!</em><br />
And then the two voices argue back and forth,<br />
Which keeps me sitting, waiting for them to settle.</p>

<p>I am not resting when I am writing.<br />
I am honestly not sure if I know how to rest at all.</p>
