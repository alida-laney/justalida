  <div class="poem-content">
    <p>I feel safest in corners.<br />
My small frame allows me to shrink, if need be, and,<br />
from the corner, I can often sense if the need will be.</p>

<p>There can be disadvantage in having two directions blocked off, but the advantage is<br />
You can always see every direction you have access to.</p>

<p>If a threat arises, it can only come from 25% of your angles, which is nice,<br />
when you have a mind prone to over-analysis.<br />
Less to absorb, less to process,<br />
more room to enjoy what’s in front of you.</p>
