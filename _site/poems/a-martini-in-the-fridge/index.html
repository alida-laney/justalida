  <h1>a martini in the fridge</h1>

  <div class="poem-content">
    <p>sometimes love is sitting through crisis.<br />
those moments where there is nothing to do<br />
but be with one another.</p>

<p>sometimes love is a mended shirt,<br />
fixed without request, worn without thought,<br />
appreciated passively for its reusability.</p>

<p>sometimes love is playing with my cat,<br />
who has become yours now, too.</p>

<p>sometimes love is overextension,<br />
sometimes it is withdrawal.</p>

<p>sometimes love is patient,<br />
and sometimes love is a well-timed shove.</p>

<p>tonight love was a mostly-made salad,<br />
sitting on the counter,<br />
waiting for its protein to be cooked,<br />
because i was on the phone<br />
with a dearly-loved friend.</p>

<p>tonight love was a second martini,<br />
prepared and let sit in the fridge,<br />
not set aside as a surprise,<br />
but made as a natural companion to yours.<br />
i feel dearly-loved tonight.</p>
