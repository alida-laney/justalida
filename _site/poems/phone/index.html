  <div class="poem-content">
    <p>i pick up my phone<br />
again<br />
to stare<br />
at the same little squares<br />
that were there<br />
when i last picked it up<br />
two minutes ago</p>

<p>this thing is an enemy<br />
and a resource,<br />
one i can’t live without,<br />
but an enemy nonetheless</p>

<p>the amount<br />
and diversity of<br />
experiences<br />
i can have<br />
on my phone<br />
is truly beyond my comprehension,<br />
as is the number of individuals<br />
who contributed<br />
to my rectangle<br />
and the squares i stare at</p>

<p>squares take me to different worlds.<br />
i am particularly fond of<br />
short videos<br />
presented via<br />
endless scrolling.<br />
my brain thinks this is social contact.</p>

<p>this is a relic<br />
of a time<br />
when my brain<br />
was starving.</p>

<p>just now, i went to scroll.<br />
i stopped the urge,<br />
but it is too easy,<br />
too accessible<br />
to numb my mind,<br />
to fill it with sensory experiences<br />
that make me feel<br />
there is nothing left to be created</p>

<p>my phone is a consumption device<br />
my mind is overfull</p>
