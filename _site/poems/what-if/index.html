    <p><em>I think, therefore I am</em></p>

<p>I am constantly thinking<br />
And so are they,<br />
The voices who share my brain with me.</p>

<p>Not long ago,<br />
I thought they were something to fight,<br />
Something to banish<br />
To exile<br />
To overcome.</p>

<p>But now,<br />
Thinking on it,<br />
Being with it,<br />
I am realizing more and more<br />
They are something to befriend.</p>

<p>When they tell me they want me dead,<br />
They are not angry with me<br />
They are protecting something they feel is right.</p>

<p>I cannot fault them for that.</p>

<p>I, too, protect what I think is right,<br />
Namely my breath and my sanity,<br />
And when they advocate for taking that away from me,<br />
It feels very much like they believe it is right to deprive me of that.</p>

<p>But why would someone who shares a brain with me<br />
Ever believe it is right to destroy the vessel that houses<br />
The place we both call home?</p>

<p>Simply put,<br />
They wouldn’t.</p>

<p>Despite what she occasionally tells me,<br />
My brain does not want me dead.<br />
She wants to protect things, people, and concepts<br />
That she’s been told will protect us both.</p>

<p>When I ignore the drive for destruction<br />
And my brain floods my body with paralyzing fear<br />
That is her saying,<br />
“It is more dangerous for us to live knowing the things we know<br />
Than it is to die”</p>

<p>What if,<br />
Instead of banishing or overcoming that thought,<br />
I think on and be with it?</p>

<p>What if,<br />
I exile my fear of understanding her,<br />
I thank her for protecting me,<br />
And I remind her to trust me when I say that we are safe?</p>

<p>What if,<br />
When a belief seemingly makes no sense,<br />
Perspective is the prescription for understanding?</p>
