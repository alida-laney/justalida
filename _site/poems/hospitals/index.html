  <div class="poem-content">
    <p>The weight of trauma unprocessed<br />
is heavy on my heart today.</p>

<p>I am in the hospital,<br />
with my partner,<br />
for them to have surgery.</p>

<p>While waiting in the pre-procedure room,<br />
a flashback of my grandmother’s end-of-life<br />
hospital stays hits me,<br />
causing my body to twitch.</p>

<p>My partner notices and asks what’s up.<br />
‘Nothing’ I say, shaking it off.</p>

<p>But my body is asking to be relieved of these horrid memories. <br />
She says, ‘You did not love her enough.’<br />
‘Remember how you failed her when she needed you most?’<br />
“Now is not the time, body,” I protest, pushing the flashes away.</p>

<p>How do I balance caring for my partner in this moment when I am mentally and physically stuck in past moments?</p>
