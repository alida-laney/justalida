  <h1>Certainty</h1>

  <p class="poem-date">March 22, 2023

  <div class="poem-content">
    <p>Scientists are certain we can’t feel our brains,<br />
Because brains have no nerve endings,<br />
And nerves are what we use to feel.</p>

<p>If that’s true,<br />
Then why,<br />
When I do something brave<br />
Or exciting<br />
Or new<br />
Or terrifying,<br />
Do I suddenly feel the space<br />
Between my ears and behind my eyes?</p>

<p>I am certain<br />
I had to learn to feel that space.<br />
And sometimes I wonder if that means<br />
I unlearned the feeling<br />
Or if,<br />
Maybe,<br />
I was taught to ignore it.</p>

<p>Maybe it doesn’t matter<br />
Because<br />
I am certain<br />
The space is there<br />
Even when I am not noticing it.</p>

<p>There are things I am certain of<br />
About the world,<br />
About my experience,<br />
About my brain,<br />
That science, logic, and reason<br />
Cannot explain.</p>

<p>I don’t think scientists mean any harm<br />
When they say they want to know something for certain<br />
Before they believe it is true.</p>

<p>But I do think,<br />
Maybe,<br />
They’ve invented their own type of certainty,<br />
One that thrives on ignoring<br />
The brave<br />
The new<br />
The exciting<br />
The terrifying,</p>

<p>And I am certain I like mine better.</p>
