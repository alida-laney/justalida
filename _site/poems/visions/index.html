  <div class="poem-content">
    <p>my dreams for the future<br />
have gained some quality.</p>

<p>not saturation,<br />
or clarity,<br />
but<br />
something.</p>

<p>i am detaching from the things i held onto.</p>

<p>it was a tough loss;<br />
hanging on brought me this far.</p>

<p>but clinging to a train whose terminal you know<br />
leaves you forgetting the joy of adventure,<br />
of not knowing where you are going to go.</p>

<p>i give myself no moments to grieve my old dreams.<br />
wallowing in past hopes makes it nearly impossible to release them.</p>

<p>my heart has found her home.</p>

<p>whatever happens from here,<br />
i am at peace with,<br />
for i have earned this<br />
lovely life.</p>
