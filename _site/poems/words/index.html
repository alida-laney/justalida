  <div class="poem-content">
    <p>When I was a child,<br />
Words were my refuge.<br />
Words on a page, in my head, or, rarely, whispered aloud<br />
Kept me safe.</p>

<p>The thing about words<br />
Is how absolutely concrete<br />
And utterly subjective<br />
The experience of a word can be</p>

<p>Safe<br />
What is it to be safe?<br />
It is to feel secure in your surroundings<br />
It is to be free from harm</p>

<p>Is that, then, really what the words did?<br />
Were they keeping me safe?<br />
Or were they merely providing a shelter<br />
For the danger I had around me?</p>

<p>Danger<br />
Harm<br />
How dangerous are things, really, if they don’t kill you?<br />
Are those things perhaps the most harmful of all?</p>

<p>What is it to be safe in a moment,<br />
As a child,<br />
If the feeling of safety<br />
Fails to bleed into adulthood?</p>

<p>Feeling<br />
What is it to feel?<br />
Truly and genuinely,<br />
I am not sure I’ve ever felt before</p>

<p>I was never safe to feel<br />
I was never free from danger<br />
I stored my harm inside words and locked them away<br />
Thinking the words would hold that feeling forever</p>

<p>But, as it turns out,<br />
Forever is just a word, too</p>
