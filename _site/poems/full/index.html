    <p><em>Define your voice!</em><br />
Shouts someone,<br />
From the mountaintops of my mind.</p>

<p>It’s funny,<br />
Because I feel like I never stop talking.</p>

<p>I’ve been through a lot of things,<br />
Bad things,<br />
And…</p>

<p>Sometimes I feel there is no defined voice of joy in me.</p>

<p>Today,<br />
My heart feels so <em>full</em>,<br />
It’s hard to describe any other way.</p>

<p>But I’d like to believe I can expand my capacity for joy;<br />
That I can turn this fullness into half-fullness,<br />
So I may make room for more and more delight.</p>

<p>Let me try, then, to define this voice of joy…</p>

<p>There is bliss in my soul;<br />
Restfulness that I once thought I might only find in death.</p>

<p>Excitement, too,<br />
Not the kind that makes you nervous,<br />
But raw, bright, yellow and green excitement.</p>

<p>There is evidence of progress and the satisfaction that comes with it.<br />
There is tenderness behind the stone-cold, walled off regions of my heart.</p>

<p>I imagine a journey,<br />
Long and treacherous,<br />
Filled with demons and trolls and riddles.<br />
The paths are windy and hilly.<br />
There was a magical forest my party briefly got lost in.<br />
We were fleeing some war; persecution;<br />
And at the end of the journey,<br />
After all the trials and tribulations,<br />
We emerged on the other side,<br />
Greeted by open pastures and blue skies.<br />
The town we happened upon was wary of us, at first,<br />
But they quickly warmed up as we told them the tales of our travels.<br />
Now, we play sword-fight with the children.<br />
One of us bakes the bread.<br />
One milks the goats in the springtime mornings.</p>

<p>It was a tale of loss, confusion, and anger,<br />
Turned into a fable about the brilliance that can take the form of determined, hardworking refugees.</p>

<p>Maybe I will tell that story someday.<br />
I certainly hope I will.</p>

<p>But for today,<br />
For now,<br />
I will bask in the warm glow of the firelight,<br />
Comfortable and confident<br />
That I have made it<br />
All the way home.</p>
