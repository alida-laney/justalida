  <h1>Twenty Twenty Four</h1>

  <div class="poem-content">
    <p>I am almost frightened to share my reflections on the year.<br />
This year was one of constant climbing.<br />
It was one of intense isolation and pressure; the kind I presume precious gemstones undergo.</p>

<p>I fear, no matter how I speak my truth, it will be misheard by the only people whose understanding I crave.</p>

<p>How many times in my life have I moved on from a person or people?<br />
How many times have I watched as people exiled me and moved on?<br />
It’s not worth dwelling on, I think.</p>

<p>What is worth dwelling on is the good things.<br />
No matter how temporary, I felt a lot of love this year.<br />
I allowed myself to feel love.</p>

<p>This was very brave; the end of twenty twenty three was the lowest I have ever been.</p>

<p>I came out of that with my heart exposed,<br />
Not because I wanted to lead with her,<br />
But because I had no energy with which to guard her.</p>

<p>I fell directly into the arms of folks in the same position.<br />
No matter what they think of me today,<br />
I am grateful to have been held by them once upon a time.</p>

<p>Now I graciously hold myself, and my love, and my tiny cat.<br />
My life is not as full as it will be in this coming year,<br />
But I am full of love, regardless.</p>

<p>Happy New Year, everyone.<br />
May this year bring love and new beginnings for us all.</p>
