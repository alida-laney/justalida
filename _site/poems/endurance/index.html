  <div class="poem-content">
    <p>i’ve spent so much of my life waiting<br />
knowing it would get better eventually.</p>

<p>i learned early on that enduring,<br />
without protest or struggle,<br />
is the easiest way to survive.</p>

<p>and endure i did. for quite a while.</p>

<p>and when i made it to this chapter in life,<br />
where knew it was over (<br />
for good )</p>

<p>my excitement almost ruined it;<br />
my eagerness almost flooded and suffocated all of the land<br />
before the seeds could begin to take root.</p>

<p>so i decided<br />
to endure<br />
once again.</p>

<p>i stayed very still.</p>

<p>and it worked;      finally,<br />
it worked.</p>
