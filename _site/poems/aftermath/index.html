  <h1>Aftermath</h1>

  <div class="poem-content">
    <p>Though things have not been fully resolved yet, my emotions are at peace.<br />
I sit comfortably in the knowing that we will be fine.<br />
And in the aftermath of my silenced torment,<br />
I find an ache so deep I cannot breathe.</p>

<p>The weight of the things I endured<br />
On top of battling my own demons<br />
Because you were unwilling to face yours<br />
Hits me.</p>

<p>More than angry, I am bitter,<br />
Almost disgusted,<br />
By your ignorance,<br />
Which I allowed for so long.</p>
