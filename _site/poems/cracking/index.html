  <h1>Cracking</h1>

  <div class="poem-content">
    <p>I am fearful<br />
That I may crack open,<br />
Bleeding pure white light<br />
Onto the ground.</p>

<p>It seeps into the soil, and<br />
Onlookers gasp in horror,<br />
“What a tragedy! What a waste!”<br />
It is true.</p>

<p>The thought to kill myself<br />
Has bubbled up a few times lately.<br />
Less as a request, More as an option.<br />
Progress.</p>

<p>I often think of meaning,<br />
How it cannot be put into words.<br />
My whole life, in pursuit of<br />
The Impossible.</p>

<p>My devastation is most holy.<br />
All other suffering is mindless.<br />
Cloaked in misery, I try it on.<br />
Play dress-up.</p>

<p>I’ve never been able to take it on and off before.<br />
Interesting.</p>
