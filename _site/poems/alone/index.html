  <div class="poem-content">
    <p>Why can I feel my body begging for water, food, cooler clothing, movement and I won’t do anything about it?<br />
I hear her crying out to me, begging me to care for her, but all seem to do is put myself on pause until I’m with another person.<br />
I know we aren’t meant to be happy all the time, but surely we’re meant to be feeding ourselves.<br />
I don’t know why I won’t eat. I’m so frustrated I want to break stuff.<br />
But I know I won’t clean up that mess.<br />
The voices in my head tell me I’m worthless.<br />
“That’s not helpful,” I tell them,<br />
“Shame doesn’t overcome, only love does”<br />
And they mock me because if I loved myself I’d be doing anything other than writing this while my stomach growls angrily.<br />
There is nothing in this house that I want to eat.<br />
My friend dared me to cook dinner but I have nothing to cook and even if I did I wouldn’t want to.</p>

<p>But I can’t disappoint her.<br />
Can’t let her know how sad I am.<br />
Why?</p>

<p>I touched my unmoisturized face, right outside my unbrushed teeth.<br />
Had I gotten out of bed when I woke up instead of right before my first meeting, those self care tasks might’ve gotten done.<br />
However, I did not.<br />
There is no purpose here</p>
