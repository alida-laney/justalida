  <h1>Relief</h1>

  <div class="poem-content">
    <p>The utter relief of knowing something is not for me<br />
Is challenging to put into words.</p>

<p>It feels like when a muscle<br />
Who didn’t know they were clenched<br />
Releases, for an instant.<br />
Gotcha.</p>

<p>And suddenly,<br />
The neural pathway<br />
For that particular release<br />
Is lingering,<br />
Warm to the touch.</p>

<p>I can trace the scent,<br />
Find the relaxation,<br />
And do it again.</p>

<p>This is why change in my life tends to move in large-scale, sweeping motions.<br />
I spent my formative years,<br />
Butt-cheeks clenched so hard it’s a miracle I didn’t turn inside-out,<br />
And that made it hard to move slowly or gradually.</p>

<p>Release often means coping with the very idea that I have been tense for so long.<br />
This used to tense me up<br />
in anticipation,<br />
in rage,<br />
in grief…<br />
It made the presence of relaxation forceful.</p>

<p>Before sniffing,<br />
I’d grab by the throat.<br />
I’m not proud of the way I pinned my release to the wall and taunted it.</p>

<p>Eventually it realized I needed the same gentle nature.</p>

<p>Things are much less tense now.</p>
