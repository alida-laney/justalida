  <h1>Before My Alarm</h1>

  <div class="poem-content">
    <p>I was woken up<br />
Before my alarm this morning.<br />
More than an hour,<br />
In fact.</p>

<p>By a little creature,<br />
Needing love.<br />
She flopped and rolled and<br />
Purred away.</p>

<p>I tried to keep my eyes closed,<br />
To not fully awake,<br />
But the creature was too wiggly,<br />
And too cute.</p>

<p>Caring for her<br />
Is one of my greatest joys.<br />
Knowing her<br />
Is an honor and a treasure.</p>

<p>I will gladly lose some sleep<br />
To give this creature love.<br />
She deserves it, and<br />
I am lucky that mine is her favorite love to get.</p>
