    <p>This collection is dedicated to You;<br />
	to the anyone and everyone who needs it;<br />
	to those of us who know the pattern all too well.</p>

<p>My journey has been painstakingly, courageously, honestly documented<br />
	for the past and future Me’s who needed it, and<br />
	for You, whoever You are.</p>

<p>I am so grateful for your time.</p>

<p>May these words linger with you as they poured out of me in each moment.</p>
