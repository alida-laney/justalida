  <h1>Writer’s Block</h1>

  <div class="poem-content">
    <p>Writer’s block feels different now than it used to<br />
A younger, wiser in some ways, version of me found it challenging to settle on an idea.<br />
She found inspiration, color, joy, purpose, and meaning in the most mundane experiences.<br />
Now<br />
I’m so overwhelmed by the idea of color<br />
That some deep purple,<br />
or maybe maroon, <br />
place within me<br />
holds my fingers back<br />
from forming<br />
words<br />
in<br />
the<br />
coldest<br />
pale<br />
blue<br />
way.</p>

<p>Letters, now accessible with a button push,<br />
Feel more red to create<br />
Than they were when I was limited by the physical speed I could scrawl them onto the page.<br />
Colors come in bursts now.</p>

<p>They used to come all at once, all the time, I think.</p>

<p>It is hard to remember<br />
When I felt so yellow in my thoughts that they spilled out effortlessly<br />
Or maybe<br />
It wasn’t yellow.<br />
Maybe it was</p>

<p>Orange.<br />
Warm, soft, sunset orange.</p>

<p>An orange knowing that I had something to say, and a blue sense of determination that my thoughts were worth recording,<br />
Just for my own bright, bold, purple satisfaction.<br />
I wonder when I stopped trusting that every color was worthy of savoring.<br />
I wonder<br />
If I will<br />
feel that<br />
beautifully<br />
multi-colored<br />
ever<br />
again</p>
