  <div class="poem-content">
    <p>I am boldly and bravely frustrated<br />
By this mission I am on in my life.</p>

<p>At every turn,<br />
People are asking me to know where I am going,<br />
But<br />
I am exploring something unseen.</p>

<p>When you are uncovering the mysteries of the universe,<br />
You, by definition, cannot know what it is you are searching for.</p>

<p>My intuition does not call out to me, like a faint angelic voice in the distance,<br />
It rises like stomach acid and bile.<br />
It churns and revolts, not just begging, but demanding to be released.</p>

<p>I am sickened by this pursuit,<br />
Yet,<br />
Like a truly necessary vomit,<br />
I know I will feel better when it has happened<br />
And I have settled<br />
On the other side.</p>
