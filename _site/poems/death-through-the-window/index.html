  <div class="poem-content">
    <p>death is waving at me through the window.<br />
it is summer.<br />
the trees are green.<br />
there is a bare, pale tree across the way,<br />
shaking her branches at me in the wind.</p>

<p>like the ghost of a life once lived,<br />
she stands there,<br />
among the living.<br />
no shame or sorrow,<br />
it is just not time for her body to go.</p>

<p>death waves at me through the window,<br />
asking me to surrender.<br />
i have died so many times in this life,<br />
i am tired of being reborn.<br />
perhaps i should be so grateful.</p>

<p>are the trees able to spiritually live again?<br />
are they devout?<br />
do they, in their ways, honor their gods?<br />
should i be so lucky for my freedom of movement,<br />
for my ability to be fluid and to reincarnate, to become something new from my same old body?</p>

<p>death waves at me through the window, and I wonder,<br />
Is she coming for me?<br />
Not for my body, but for my essence, again?<br />
I inhale deeply.<br />
I wave back.</p>

<p>Death stays still.<br />
The green leaves sway in the breeze.</p>
