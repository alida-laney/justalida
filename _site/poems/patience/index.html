  <div class="poem-content">
    <p>Days ago,<br />
I saw a sign that read,<br />
in loud, all-caps font:<br />
EXPECT DELAYS.</p>

<p>I exhaled.<br />
I nodded.<br />
I carried on.<br />
Delays are expected.</p>

<p>In their own ways,<br />
the Gods assure me<br />
I am aligned,<br />
destined for great things.</p>

<p>The path has yet to be illuminated.<br />
So, yes, I expect delays.<br />
How could one not be delayed<br />
when they can’t see where they are going?</p>

<p>I think about the blind population.<br />
They simply leave early (I presume).<br />
They make it where they need to be.<br />
I ought to be more grateful.</p>

<p>If I expect delays with solemn acceptance,<br />
Things will be delayed begrudgingly.<br />
If I expect delays with excitement,<br />
what then?</p>

<p>Perhaps blessings are delayed because<br />
they are being meticulously wrapped.<br />
I am willing to believe that.<br />
Delayed gratification can be fun.</p>

<p>It is decided, then.<br />
I will wait with pleasure,<br />
With joy and trust,<br />
and I will accept my blessings with leisure.</p>
