  <h1>Belief</h1>

  <div class="poem-content">
    <p>Our beliefs inform our reality.<br />
I know this to be true.</p>

<p>There is some piece of me, still,<br />
Who believes tragedy is a must in my life.</p>

<p>Twenty-five years of suffering,<br />
twenty-five of joy,<br />
and then back again,<br />
is the belief.</p>

<p>You’d think, for how many generations of suffering came before me,<br />
I’d find it easy to believe that all my hard work means I’ve earned a joyous life.</p>

<p>It is not so,<br />
unfortunately.</p>

<p>This belief can be changed, though.<br />
Change it I must.</p>

<p>I refuse to allow the presence of this belief to beget twenty-five more years of suffering.</p>

<p>On this day,<br />
let the seed be planted,<br />
I have earned this life.<br />
I deserve joy.</p>

<p>May joy take root and be nourished by the soil around it.<br />
May this seed grow with fervent abundance so all might be in awe of her splendor.<br />
May her lushness be ever apparent, as if the divine planted her herself.</p>

<p>In many ways,<br />
I am divinity.<br />
In others,<br />
I am only a woman.</p>

<p>Is there a difference?</p>

<p>I suppose, it depends<br />
on your beliefs.</p>
