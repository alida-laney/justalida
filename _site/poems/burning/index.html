  <div class="poem-content">
    <p>there is a white hot searing pain in my chest.<br />
i wish for it to go away.</p>

<p>it is sitting there, unmoving, and i am angry.<br />
i try not to be angry at the feeling anymore.<br />
(i used to be very angry at my feelings, <br />
all of them except pride)</p>

<p>this time, i don’t feel angry at the feeling itself.<br />
i’m angry at the uncertainty it reminds me of.<br />
things in my life feel like they are finalizing, in some way.<br />
and simultaneously, i feel as if i was foolish to think things were as extreme as i felt they were.</p>

<p>if i had just…<br />
i could have said…<br />
what if i had…</p>

<p>every time i question my past self, the searing intensifies.<br />
it feels cruel, how that works.</p>

<p><em>there is most resistance right before a breakthrough,</em><br />
whispers my mind.<br />
she is right.<br />
i am frustrated, though.</p>
