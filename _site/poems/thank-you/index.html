  <h1>Thank You</h1>

  <div class="poem-content">
    <p><em>‘Thank you’</em><br />
I say to the voice yelling at me to kill myself.</p>

<p>Voices,<br />
I should say.<br />
There’s more than one,<br />
As there always are.</p>

<p>They stand in a circle<br />
And take eager,<br />
Excitedly overlapping turns<br />
Saying the things they say to me.</p>

<p>I used to whisper the <em>’Thank you’</em><br />
And,<br />
for a while after that,<br />
I yelled it<br />
In the same tone<br />
They use when they speak to me .</p>

<p>I’d like to tell you<br />
That, at some point,<br />
I learned to soften my tone and speak with compassion<br />
Because<br />
I am selfless and endlessly empathetic.<br />
But, no.</p>

<p>My firm softness<br />
Began as the bravery of the whisper,<br />
Which morphed into an angry defiance,<br />
That faded to exhaustion,<br />
And then to a plea,<br />
But the desperation only made them louder.</p>

<p>It was then, lost in that desperation,<br />
I remembered<br />
That I do not want to die.<br />
And that will to live taught me to be gentle with myself,<br />
To give myself grace<br />
When I have Loud Voice days.</p>

<p>There is no grand reason<br />
That I developed compassion for the voices.<br />
I simply want to live,<br />
And, much as I don’t like it,<br />
Those voices are me,<br />
So I will keep thanking them</p>

<p>Until they, too,<br />
Learn that they want to live.</p>
