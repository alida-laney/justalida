  <h1>How On Earth</h1>

  <div class="poem-content">
    <p>How on Earth<br />
Can I spend the morning<br />
Writing sad songs,<br />
	Stewing in anguish,<br />
		Unable to move these emotions through my body,</p>

<p>But then<br />
The moment I step upstairs<br />
	To settle into the anger<br />
You text me?</p>

<p>We talk about your things.<br />
You ask for a call tomorrow.<br />
I say,<br />
	Yes please,<br />
	I need that so desperately.<br />
You ask why.<br />
My things are family things again;<br />
A new version of the same things<br />
You’ve heard for years now.</p>

<p>I tell you I feel guilty asking for support.<br />
You say,<br />
	GIRL,<br />
	That’s my job!<br />
And I feel the brightness of three suns in my heart.</p>

<p>We exchange voice messages.<br />
You validate everything I’m feeling.<br />
I draft an email and send it,<br />
After getting your sign-off.</p>

<p>There is so, painfully, little<br />
I feel I can do<br />
To express<br />
How an hour long text exchange<br />
Has the power to change the trajectory<br />
Of my day,<br />
	my weekend,<br />
		my life.</p>

<p>At a loss for words,<br />
I ask again,<br />
How on Earth could our bond be so strong?<br />
Then I think,<br />
Only Heaven might connect two souls in this way.</p>

<p>You are a kind of soulmate we’ve forgotten to long for,<br />
But one I could not persist in this life without.<br />
My most treasured friend and sister.</p>
