excerpt: "Year after year."

Public school drilled this habit into me.  
I am not certain, yet, whether this is fortunate or un-,  
But that wondering lacks nuance.  

Anyway,  
I think that’s what I’ve done here,  
In this collection,  
In some way,  
At least.  

So much of my energy, effort, and exertion  
Have been dedicated to documenting  
For the sake of someone following along later on.  

I hope  
…  
I hope  
I’ve made  
A follow-able map.  

The funny thing about  
Solving problems you can’t yet name is  
You don’t know what work  
You’re meant to show…  

Please,  
oh please,  
keep  
following  
along.
