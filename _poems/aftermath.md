excerpt: "My emotions are at peace."
---

Though things have not been fully resolved yet, my emotions are at peace.  
I sit comfortably in the knowing that we will be fine.  
And in the aftermath of my silenced torment,  
I find an ache so deep I cannot breathe.  

The weight of the things I endured  
On top of battling my own demons  
Because you were unwilling to face yours  
Hits me.  

More than angry, I am bitter,  
Almost disgusted,  
By your ignorance,  
Which I allowed for so long.
