excerpt: "Take control of your calm."
---

You're allowed to rest,  
To hold yourself.  

It's more potent,  
More powerful,  
To take control  
Of your calm.  

Centering yourself,  
Grounding into your own ethics,  
Is best for the world.  

Trust in your own compass;  
Trust that North is within you.  
You will be okay.  

I promise,  
You will  
Be  
Okay.
