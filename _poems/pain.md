excerpt: "This eased my pain."
---

Pain sits in my chest,  
Unmoving,  

Like a vat of purplish-redish, viscous fluid;  
Like a bruise made of mucous,  
The kind that lingers in your lungs after a persistent cold.  

I moan and groan, yet  
Hurt remains.  

Somehow, though,  
I feel on-the-mend;  
There is energy growing.  

In quiet stillness, my mind’s eye casts a vision:  
Somewhere,  
Below the clog  
Is a drip.  

One thick, bloody drop at a time,  
Ache slips away,  
Landing in a warm, shimmery puddle of gold.  

It seems, these days,  
Even in the worst moments,  
My metabolism is tuned to refine darkness into light.  

I am shocked to report:  
This eases my pain.
