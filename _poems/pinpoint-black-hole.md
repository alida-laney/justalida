excerpt: "the symbol... traverses layers of interpretation"
---

I often think of the significance of symbols.  
When a shape, word, person, or moment becomes **representative**,  
It gains a quality.  

I call this quality **density**.  
For whatever the symbol is, its meaning  
Traverses layers of interpretation  
Beyond simplistic truth.  

When I live through a symbolic moment,  
I am often inclined to react to its symbolism;  
To its density;  
Rather than the actual space it takes up.  

These pinpoint black holes dot my life story like stars in the night sky.  
Noticing the density and not allowing myself to be pulled by it  
Has fueled the development of my own center of gravity.  

All that is to say,  
**Growth**  
Is often expansive awareness  
Combined with selective reactivity.
