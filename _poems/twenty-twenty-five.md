excerpt: "The message I've sent myself is clear"

Another year has passed.
This one felt more *alive*, somehow.

At the end of Twenty Twenty Four, I was
Red hot, ready to turn to coals at the bottom of a long-roasting fire.

This year, I’m gleeful,
Believe it or not.

I’ve accomplished so much,
It’s hard to recall exactly what I’ve done.

I just know it’s been good.
I am not red hot coals this year.

I’m just a woman,
typing away on her little computer,
which, I guess,
is what I’ve always been.

In commemoration of this year, I published this website today.

At long last, my private, closely kept project is unleashed.

There’s no need for resolutions; the message I've sent myself is loud and clear:

**Keep the ball rolling into the new year!**
