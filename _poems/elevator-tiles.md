excerpt: "Worn unevenly..."
---

Worn unevenly, because the buttons are on one side.  
When I enter, I notice, every time.  

I wonder if the unworn tiles feel unloved, so I step my foot to the rarely-touched corner.  
Then, I am flooded with embarrassment, because, what if they are so grateful to not be so worn?  

The doors open and I leave the tiles behind until my next journey.
