excerpt: "my reflections on the year"
---

I am almost frightened to share my reflections on the year.  
This year was one of constant climbing.  
It was one of intense isolation and pressure; the kind I presume precious gemstones undergo.  

I fear, no matter how I speak my truth, it will be misheard by the only people whose understanding I crave.  

How many times in my life have I moved on from a person or people?  
How many times have I watched as people exiled me and moved on?  
It’s not worth dwelling on, I think.  

What is worth dwelling on is the good things.  
No matter how temporary, I felt a lot of love this year.  
I allowed myself to feel love.  

This was very brave; the end of twenty twenty three was the lowest I have ever been.  

I came out of that with my heart exposed,  
Not because I wanted to lead with her,  
But because I had no energy with which to guard her.  

I fell directly into the arms of folks in the same position.  
No matter what they think of me today,  
I am grateful to have been held by them once upon a time.  

Now I graciously hold myself, and my love, and my tiny cat.  
My life is not as full as it will be in this coming year,  
But I am full of love, regardless.  

Happy New Year, everyone.  
May this year bring love and new beginnings for us all.
