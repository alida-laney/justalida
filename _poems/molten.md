excerpt: "Injustice, sustained"
---

There is a lava lamp of  
Molten glass in my torso,  
Sinking and rising,  
Slowly.  

Injustice, sustained,  
Is hot and sluggish.  

Bubbles form.  
The sensation of pulling away  
From the mass at the bottom  
Churns my stomach.  

I find the process  
Unsettling.
