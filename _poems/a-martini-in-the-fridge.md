excerpt: "i feel dearly-loved"
---

sometimes love is sitting through crisis.  
those moments where there is nothing to do  
but be with one another.  

sometimes love is a mended shirt,  
fixed without request, worn without thought,  
appreciated passively for its reusability.  

sometimes love is playing with my cat,  
who has become yours now, too.  

sometimes love is overextension,  
sometimes it is withdrawal.  

sometimes love is patient,  
and sometimes love is a well-timed shove.  

tonight love was a mostly-made salad,  
sitting on the counter,  
waiting for its protein to be cooked,  
because i was on the phone  
with a dearly-loved friend.  

tonight love was a second martini,  
prepared and let sit in the fridge,  
not set aside as a surprise,  
but made as a natural companion to yours.  
i feel dearly-loved tonight.
