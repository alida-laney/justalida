excerpt: "there is a white hot searing pain in my chest."
---

there is a white hot searing pain in my chest.  
i wish for it to go away.  

it is sitting there, unmoving, and i am angry.  
i try not to be angry at the feeling anymore.  
(i used to be very angry at my feelings,   
all of them except pride)  

this time, i don’t feel angry at the feeling itself.  
i’m angry at the uncertainty it reminds me of.  
things in my life feel like they are finalizing, in some way.  
and simultaneously, i feel as if i was foolish to think things were as extreme as i felt they were.  

if i had just…  
i could have said…  
what if i had…  

every time i question my past self, the searing intensifies.  
it feels cruel, how that works.  

*there is most resistance right before a breakthrough,*  
whispers my mind.  
she is right.  
i am frustrated, though.
