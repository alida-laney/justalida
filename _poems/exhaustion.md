excerpt: "there are no more decisions to be made"
---

it occurred to me  
, all at once,  
that i have not written  
; documented;  
in weeks.  

it used to be much more important to me  
, the documentation,  
but since i learned to start trusting myself  
; my memory;  
it’s become less-so.  

still, though, i feel compelled to catalogue.  
as if my thoughts *in the moment*  
are somehow more pure than  
thoughts produced while looking back on  
; reminiscing.
