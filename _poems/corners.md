excerpt: "I feel safest in corners."
---

I feel safest in corners.  
My small frame allows me to shrink, if need be, and,  
from the corner, I can often sense if the need will be.  

There can be disadvantage in having two directions blocked off, but the advantage is  
You can always see every direction you have access to.  

If a threat arises, it can only come from 25% of your angles, which is nice,  
when you have a mind prone to over-analysis.  
Less to absorb, less to process,  
more room to enjoy what’s in front of you.
