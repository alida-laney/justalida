excerpt: "I am greatly pleased today."
---

I am greatly pleased today.  
Not all days hold such tangible moments of alignment.  

As worried as I am,  
I am ready.  

Next steps aren’t to be planned or organized or orchestrated,  
Not by me, at least.  

I am simply a feather,  
Dropped by a passing bird,  
Caught by the gentle breeze,  
Intersecting briefly with the leaf of a tree, then  
Floating,  
Swaying,  
Settling  
Down,  
Finding my resting place on the ground,  
Where I may be found,  
By a pen-maker,  
Who can turn my body into a tool,  
And use me with delight  
For years to come.  

Does the feather,  
As it is floating gently down,  
Know of the whole journey to come?  

It is not worth debating, because  
The journey will be, regardless.  

My soul knows it is here for a purpose;  
I am delighted, today, to be dipping my toes  
Into the river that flows  
towards the ocean  
of my influence.  

Amen.
