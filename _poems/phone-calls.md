Hello!

Oh-Yes

Mhm

O k

I’m sorry, that sounds tough

*Get your priorities straight, you’re wasting energy on things that don’t matter.*
*You’re reacting to things in your past instead of what is happening right now*

What- oh, yeah, I agree.

So unfair.

The world is against you.  
Your situation has nothing to do with your own actions,  

*no, of course not.*

Yeah, I get that.

That’s so frustrating, I’m sorry.

*This conversation is a waste of time-*  
*This is my mom I owe her-*  
*I owe her nothing she’s taken from me my whole-*  

Yeah, okay, I see.

By the way, I’m gonna have to go soo  
*Yeah, no that’s fine, whatever. I said what I needed to. I’ll let her go for two more minutes and say goodbye.*

*Breathe. You’ll be okay.*  
*End the conversation.*  
*You have to live your own life.*  
*You’re doing more than enough.*  

Okay, Mom, I’m sorry, but I’m gonna have to hop off-  
No no that’s fine, I just have to-  
Ok. Yeah. Okay, sounds good.  
Love you too.  
I’m sorry.  
Mhm
