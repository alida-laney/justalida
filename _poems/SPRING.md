excerpt: "Year after year."

Never do I feel my lungs celebrate  
quite as they do during the goodbye-winter transition.  

The air feels thicker,  
maybe with pollen,  
but mostly with humidity.  

The wind, once abrasive against my skin,  
is now a caress, teasing my cheeks and fingers,  
enticing the heavy layers of clothing to shed.  

*Thank God,*  
I whisper.  
Year after year.
