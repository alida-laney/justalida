excerpt: "I can do it."

The presence of Human Connection  
Ought not to feel so strange,  
I think.  

Whenever it happens,  
I feel  

scared,  

Like…  

I’m doing something bad.  

Sometimes people say I should do what feels right,  
But  
What if what is right feels wrong?  
What then?  

Do I do it and do it until it stops feeling this way?  
Is there another option  
Besides succumbing to the belief that I cannot connect?  

Because,  
	And here’s the thing,  
I must be able to connect.  

I’m feeling bad when I’m feeling connection.  

If experience serves me here,  
	then,  
I can retrain myself to:  
1. Notice the presence of this ‘bad’ feeling  
2. Label it “Connection”  
3. Remind myself why “Connection” and “Bad” have been associated  
4. Start to decide this sensation is ‘good’  

I’ve done this with other things - sex, sobriety, advocating for my needs.  
I can do it.  

I can do it.  

I.    can.    do.    it.
