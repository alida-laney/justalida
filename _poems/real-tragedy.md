excerpt: "I saw all the darkness and loved across it."
---

You were there when my magic woke up.  

It was an effortful weaving of tapestry,  
Making the relationship happen,  
But I loved dancing that dance.  

I remember what I saw in you,  
How I felt.  

It’s not that there wasn’t something real,  
As much as it was endless, tireless work for me.  

I still believed myself unworthy,  
Still believed the labor of love was upheaval.  

To love myself has been to transform;  
I must have thought the same of you  
And tried to make that happen.  

Change has saved me, and so,  
With hope and care, I tended to your goodness,  
Neverminding the thorn-pricks of your fear.  

I saw all the darkness and loved across it.  
I placed seeds of faith into the cracks of your concrete,  
Hoping soil would find its way to me.  

I was too weary to find my own soil back then.  
I will forgive myself, in time.  

Our friends tell me you’re moving  
Like you know you did something wrong.  
I can’t imagine why.  

Starving a woman for personhood,  
Only releasing her with violence on your breath,  
Hiding away while she escapes.  
Those are things proud men do,  
Right?  

It’s not hate that I feel for you, not quite.   
It’s closer to pity.  

“You’ll never find someone like me again!”  
Is a platitude for my ego;  
You clearly didn’t want someone like me.  

And that’s the real tragedy.  
A woman driven by hope and movement is  
A woman of life.  

Starving me of my aliveness because you are ashamed of yours?  

That reads as a death sentence for you.
