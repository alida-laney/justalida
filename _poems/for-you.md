excerpt: "I am so grateful for your time."
---

This collection is dedicated to You;  
	to the anyone and everyone who needs it;  
	to those of us who know the pattern all too well.  

My journey has been painstakingly, courageously, honestly documented  
	for the past and future Me’s who needed it, and  
	for You, whoever You are.  

I am so grateful for your time.  

May these words linger with you as they poured out of me in each moment.
