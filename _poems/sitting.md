excerpt: "I've been doing a lot of sitting around and waiting lately."
---

I’ve been doing a lot of sitting around and waiting lately.  
Sometimes, when I am sitting around and waiting,  
I get the urge to get up and do something.  
Then, usually, something in my brain says,  
*No! You have done too much, you need rest!*  
So I continue sitting around and waiting.  
After a while, another voice appears and shouts,  
*Little steps every day turn into progress over time!*  
And then the two voices argue back and forth,  
Which keeps me sitting, waiting for them to settle.  

I am not resting when I am writing.  
I am honestly not sure if I know how to rest at all.
