excerpt: "In the moments my vision returned..."
---

In the moments my vision returned,  
I was weary.  

I had reclaimed my sovereignty,  
Moments before,  
Through raw determination and persistence.  

I climbed the stairs,  
Looked into my future bedroom,  
And felt love.  

I collapsed onto the future guest bed,  
Exhausted,  
But not too tired to document.  

Every piece of writing  
Is a love letter across time,  
To the souls I can feel but cannot yet see.  

May I never again be so contained  
That I fear my own guiding glimpses  
Into brighter futures.
