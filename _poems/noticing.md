<u>Noticing</u>  

It is the first and most challenging step in learning to feel your feelings.  
How ironic it is that we’ve unlearned how to *feel* a *feeling.*  

I notice that thought.  

It draws attention to itself in the most covert way.  
This poem was meant to be about joy.  
I sat down to notice my joy and experience it in the moment.  
Instead, I was met with a paradox  

<u>Intellectualizing</u>  

What is it to intellectualize an emotion?  
I think to myself,  
As I tuck my joy away  
In favor of noticing that thought  

I sit with it,  
the *feeling* of *noticing*,  
now far removed  
from the joy I sat down to embrace  

<u>Sitting</u>  

Therapists say to “sit with your emotions”  
And so I do that,  
But sitting does not put my mind to rest.  
How can I tell my brain to rest?  

How can I say to her,  
When she so clearly knows,  
As, here I am, having this thought,  
That she needs to sit and rest?  

<u>Rest</u>  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
And it suddenly occurs to me,  
I cannot *tell* her to rest.  
*She* is *me*  
And me is noticing her noticing me noticing her noticing noticing noticing  
  
  
  
  
<u>Feeling</u> is not noticing  
It is not labeling or speaking about or thinking about -  
It is  
*feeling*  
  
Breathing into the hug of tightness in my chest when it wants to burst with joy  
Leaning into the warmth of the butterflies in my tummy that remind me of times when I could not breathe  
  
  
  
  
  
And I feel them relax  
  
  
When they realize   
I am breathing  
  
The muscles in my body are tense and tender  
From years of them feeling what I could not.  
But I am my body and she is me  
*She* was feeling it this whole time  
  
We feel a sigh escape our lips  
and the hug in my chest turns to a tight grip.  
How unfortunate it is that I-  
  
The suffocation yields to softness  
  
  
how beautiful it is  
that I get to experience something so  
  
human,  
  
so innate,  
  
on such an intimate level
