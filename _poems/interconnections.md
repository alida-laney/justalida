excerpt: "This is radical"
---

After an extended pause,  
One long enough for my fingertips to regain their softness,  
I picked up my guitar again.  

I sing from my chest when the instrument covers my heart.  

Anyway,  
not the point.  

I’ve been playing the piano, recently, instead;  
It is not the same.  

Also not the point.  

I played a song I know well,  
a song in G minor.  
Set the capo at 3, play Em, C, G, and D shapes - in the bridge bring in Am.  
Cool.  

On the piano,  
I’ve been playing around and around the circle of fourths,  
In mostly major keys,  
With a notable exception for G minor and C minor.  

C minor  
Comes after G minor.  

Capo set at 3 means that bridge shape, Am,  
Is the root of the next key.  
A lot of the shapes overlap - Em, C, G.  
Play Dm instead, and we’ve got a key.  

Guitar-only-Alida  
Could never’ve.  

But because I have nurtured my connection with music  
From multiple angles,  
I *can*.  

It’s not a small thing,  
The interconnections of my mind.  

Every time I build muscles across disciplines,  
I strengthen the muscle of reaching across divides.  

This is radical,  
When applied to domains  
Outside of music.
