excerpt: "I am lucky"
---

I was woken up  
Before my alarm this morning.  
More than an hour,  
In fact.  

By a little creature,  
Needing love.  
She flopped and rolled and  
Purred away.  

I tried to keep my eyes closed,  
To not fully awake,  
But the creature was too wiggly,  
And too cute.  

Caring for her  
Is one of my greatest joys.  
Knowing her  
Is an honor and a treasure.  

I will gladly lose some sleep  
To give this creature love.  
She deserves it, and  
I am lucky that mine is her favorite love to get.
