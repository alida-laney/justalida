excerpt: "Something feels bad."
---

Something feels bad.  
Numb bad…  

Like… I should be happy,  
    but I’m frightened.  

I told myself I’d eat and then I sat down to care for my cat and now I’m too numb to get back on track.  

Now it’s panic  
    rising in my chest.  

Why is every step forward  
    accompanied by a lateral landslide?  

Nothing is meaningless, and  
    Every setback is an opportunity to learn.  

Still,  
I am starving.  

When will it be my turn  
    to enjoy the journey
