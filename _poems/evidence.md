excerpt: "Just this morning, a sign came."
---

I grew up in a rigidly scientific family.  
External evidence was king.  

My father was not religious,  
For many reasons, but  
One such reason was:  
“There is no evidence.”  

He’d prattle on about how  
“Scientists have never found a soul in our bodies,” and  
He’d loudly proclaim the burden of proof  
Falls on the party making the claim.  

He loved the American legal system.  

Anyway,  
As I’ve grown,  
I’ve come to appreciate how utterly full of shit he was.  
You’d have to be ignorant,  
To not see the evidence.  

Cardinals follow me.  
They duck in and out of my skyline,  
Little flecks of red,  
Reminding me of color and warmth  
During cold winter seasons.  

Numbers are everywhere I look.  
They speak to me in codes,  
Gently nudging me along the path,  
Guiding me with information about  
Where I am now and where I will be soon.  

Just this morning, a sign came.  
As I loaded my car for the final time,  
Fleeing a home that imprisoned me,  
I turned on the bathroom light  
To find the bulb  
Above my former sink  
Burnt out.  

That’s evidence enough, for me.
