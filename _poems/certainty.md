excerpt: "I am certain I like mine better"
---

Scientists are certain we can’t feel our brains,  
Because brains have no nerve endings,  
And nerves are what we use to feel.  

If that’s true,  
Then why,  
When I do something brave  
Or exciting  
Or new  
Or terrifying,  
Do I suddenly feel the space  
Between my ears and behind my eyes?  

I am certain  
I had to learn to feel that space.  
And sometimes I wonder if that means  
I unlearned the feeling  
Or if,  
Maybe,  
I was taught to ignore it.  

Maybe it doesn’t matter  
Because  
I am certain  
The space is there  
Even when I am not noticing it.  

There are things I am certain of  
About the world,  
About my experience,  
About my brain,  
That science, logic, and reason  
Cannot explain.  

I don’t think scientists mean any harm  
When they say they want to know something for certain  
Before they believe it is true.  

But I do think,  
Maybe,  
They’ve invented their own type of certainty,  
One that thrives on ignoring  
The brave  
The new  
The exciting  
The terrifying,  

And I am certain I like mine better.
