excerpt: "Writer's block feels different now than it used to."
---

Writer’s block feels different now than it used to  
A younger, wiser in some ways, version of me found it challenging to settle on an idea.  
She found inspiration, color, joy, purpose, and meaning in the most mundane experiences.  
Now  
I’m so overwhelmed by the idea of color  
That some deep purple,  
or maybe maroon,   
place within me  
holds my fingers back  
from forming  
words  
in  
the  
coldest  
pale  
blue  
way.  

Letters, now accessible with a button push,  
Feel more red to create  
Than they were when I was limited by the physical speed I could scrawl them onto the page.  
Colors come in bursts now.  

They used to come all at once, all the time, I think.  

It is hard to remember  
When I felt so yellow in my thoughts that they spilled out effortlessly  
Or maybe  
It wasn’t yellow.  
Maybe it was  

Orange.  
Warm, soft, sunset orange.  

An orange knowing that I had something to say, and a blue sense of determination that my thoughts were worth recording,  
Just for my own bright, bold, purple satisfaction.  
I wonder when I stopped trusting that every color was worthy of savoring.  
I wonder  
If I will  
feel that  
beautifully  
multi-colored  
ever  
again
