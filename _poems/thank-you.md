excerpt: "Thank you to the voices..."
---

*‘Thank you’*  
I say to the voice yelling at me to kill myself.  

Voices,  
I should say.  
There’s more than one,  
As there always are.  

They stand in a circle  
And take eager,  
Excitedly overlapping turns  
Saying the things they say to me.  

I used to whisper the *’Thank you’*  
And,  
for a while after that,  
I yelled it  
In the same tone  
They use when they speak to me . 

I’d like to tell you  
That, at some point,  
I learned to soften my tone and speak with compassion  
Because  
I am selfless and endlessly empathetic.  
But, no.  

My firm softness  
Began as the bravery of the whisper,  
Which morphed into an angry defiance,  
That faded to exhaustion,  
And then to a plea,  
But the desperation only made them louder.  

It was then, lost in that desperation,  
I remembered  
That I do not want to die.  
And that will to live taught me to be gentle with myself,  
To give myself grace  
When I have Loud Voice days.  

There is no grand reason  
That I developed compassion for the voices.  
I simply want to live,  
And, much as I don’t like it,  
Those voices are me,  
So I will keep thanking them  

Until they, too,  
Learn that they want to live.
