How on Earth  
Can I spend the morning  
Writing sad songs,  
	Stewing in anguish,  
		Unable to move these emotions through my body,  

But then  
The moment I step upstairs  
	To settle into the anger  
You text me?  

We talk about your things.  
You ask for a call tomorrow.  
I say,  
	Yes please,  
	I need that so desperately.  
You ask why.  
My things are family things again;  
A new version of the same things  
You’ve heard for years now.  

I tell you I feel guilty asking for support.  
You say,  
	GIRL,  
	That’s my job!  
And I feel the brightness of three suns in my heart.  

We exchange voice messages.  
You validate everything I’m feeling.  
I draft an email and send it,  
After getting your sign-off.  

There is so, painfully, little  
I feel I can do  
To express  
How an hour long text exchange  
Has the power to change the trajectory  
Of my day,  
	my weekend,  
		my life.  

At a loss for words,  
I ask again,  
How on Earth could our bond be so strong?  
Then I think,  
Only Heaven might connect two souls in this way.  

You are a kind of soulmate we’ve forgotten to long for,  
But one I could not persist in this life without.  
My most treasured friend and sister.
