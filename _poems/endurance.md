excerpt: "it worked."
---

i’ve spent so much of my life waiting  
knowing it would get better eventually.  

i learned early on that enduring,  
without protest or struggle,  
is the easiest way to survive.  

and endure i did. for quite a while.  

and when i made it to this chapter in life,  
where knew it was over (  
for good )  

my excitement almost ruined it;  
my eagerness almost flooded and suffocated all of the land  
before the seeds could begin to take root.  

so i decided  
to endure  
once again.  

i stayed very still.  

and it worked;      finally,  
it worked.
