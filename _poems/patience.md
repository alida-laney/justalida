excerpt: "EXPECT DELAYS."
---

Days ago,  
I saw a sign that read,  
in loud, all-caps font:  
EXPECT DELAYS.  

I exhaled.  
I nodded.  
I carried on.  
Delays are expected.  

In their own ways,  
the Gods assure me  
I am aligned,  
destined for great things.  

The path has yet to be illuminated.  
So, yes, I expect delays.  
How could one not be delayed  
when they can’t see where they are going?  

I think about the blind population.  
They simply leave early (I presume).  
They make it where they need to be.  
I ought to be more grateful.  

If I expect delays with solemn acceptance,  
Things will be delayed begrudgingly.  
If I expect delays with excitement,  
what then?  

Perhaps blessings are delayed because  
they are being meticulously wrapped.  
I am willing to believe that.  
Delayed gratification can be fun.  

It is decided, then.  
I will wait with pleasure,  
With joy and trust,  
and I will accept my blessings with leisure.
