excerpt: "I thought this feeling was explosive."
---

I thought this feeling was explosive.  
… Hard to control.  

I’m realizing  
I am a more angry person than most.  

The fire  
Has always been there.  

It wasn’t something to find or unleash.  
It was something to become,  

To accept as the baseline  
Of my frequency.  

Anger is always with me;  
I am always angry.  

There’s no failure in that; Look around,  
There’s plenty to be angry about.  

The failure is in letting anger exhaust you,
Instead of fuel you.  

Anger reminds me to feed myself every day.  
Anger brings me back to my keyboard, when I must write a poem.  

She slams her hand onto my back, once, firmly, and says,  
“Do Something.”  

Back when I failed to understand her, I thought she said,  
“Do Everything! All At Once! Now!”  

But no.  
Anger is patient.  

One thing.  
At a time.  
And.  

Anger  
Accumulates  
Into Power.
