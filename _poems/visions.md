excerpt: "i am detaching from the things i held onto."
---

my dreams for the future  
have gained some quality.  

not saturation,  
or clarity,  
but  
something.  

i am detaching from the things i held onto.  

it was a tough loss;  
hanging on brought me this far.  

but clinging to a train whose terminal you know  
leaves you forgetting the joy of adventure,  
of not knowing where you are going to go.  

i give myself no moments to grieve my old dreams.  
wallowing in past hopes makes it nearly impossible to release them.  

my heart has found her home.  

whatever happens from here,  
i am at peace with,  
for i have earned this  
lovely life.
