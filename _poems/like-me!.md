excerpt: "I am new, somehow."
---

Life looks different tomorrow.  

Moments like this are fun, I think.  

When chapters end in big ways,  
New ones start with the same bigness.  

I could spend these moments fretting.  
I could spend them daydreaming.  

Instead,  
I notice the lifting in my chest,  
The way my heart can’t help but beat stronger.  

I notice the closure in my body.  
It’s a feeling I’ve never felt without drowning in bittersweetness.  

My whole being has turned over.  
I am new, somehow.  
Refined.  

It’s an increase in purity, that’s what I’m sensing!  

Suddenly, there’s more *me* here.  

Yeah,  
That's it.  
I just feel  
Like  
Me!
