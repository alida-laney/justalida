excerpt: "I won't do anything about it."
---

Why can I feel my body begging for water, food, cooler clothing, movement and I won’t do anything about it?  
I hear her crying out to me, begging me to care for her, but all seem to do is put myself on pause until I’m with another person.  
I know we aren’t meant to be happy all the time, but surely we’re meant to be feeding ourselves.  
I don’t know why I won’t eat. I’m so frustrated I want to break stuff.  
But I know I won’t clean up that mess.  
The voices in my head tell me I’m worthless.  
“That’s not helpful,” I tell them,  
“Shame doesn’t overcome, only love does”  
And they mock me because if I loved myself I’d be doing anything other than writing this while my stomach growls angrily.  
There is nothing in this house that I want to eat.  
My friend dared me to cook dinner but I have nothing to cook and even if I did I wouldn’t want to.  

But I can’t disappoint her.  
Can’t let her know how sad I am.  
Why?  

I touched my unmoisturized face, right outside my unbrushed teeth.  
Had I gotten out of bed when I woke up instead of right before my first meeting, those self care tasks might’ve gotten done.  
However, I did not.  
There is no purpose here
