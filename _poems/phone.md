excerpt: "i pick up my phone again..."
---

i pick up my phone  
again  
to stare  
at the same little squares  
that were there  
when i last picked it up  
two minutes ago  

this thing is an enemy  
and a resource,  
one i can’t live without,  
but an enemy nonetheless  

the amount  
and diversity of  
experiences  
i can have  
on my phone  
is truly beyond my comprehension,  
as is the number of individuals  
who contributed  
to my rectangle  
and the squares i stare at  

squares take me to different worlds.  
i am particularly fond of  
short videos  
presented via  
endless scrolling.  
my brain thinks this is social contact.  

this is a relic  
of a time  
when my brain  
was starving.  

just now, i went to scroll.  
i stopped the urge,  
but it is too easy,  
too accessible  
to numb my mind,  
to fill it with sensory experiences  
that make me feel  
there is nothing left to be created  

my phone is a consumption device  
my mind is overfull
