excerpt: "I am fine mist"
---

I am fine mist,  
Dispersed through the air,  

Free to linger  
After each previous iteration of my life  
Demanded form of me.  

Early on,  
My mist dripped steadily through a faucet,  
Always punctual and predictable.  

My mist trickled through the playground mulch,  
Forming sawdusty puddles by the thresholds.  
That’s where I spent my adolescence.  

Then there were the years of the creek.  
A forgotten trickle through the conserved patches of trees,  
Sprinkled throughout a manicured university campus.  

A good one came after that.  
Flash flood.  
Powerful destruction.  

The stagnant, murky water that followed  
Took eons to drain  
And rotted all the houses away.  

I tried, then, to be a woman.  
Bound by flesh and tenderness and desire.  
Blood is too thick for me, I’ve decided.  

In a sharp and quick exhale,  
I sublimed,  
Back to my natural state.  

It’s been so long,  
I’d forgotten how refreshing it feels  
To be mist.  

I am the familiar sensation  
Of a cool, moist, dewy  
Spring morning.  

I am mist, awaiting a blade of grass.  
I feel the surface tension growing.  
Soon, I will be pulled  
Into a dewdrop.  

For now,  
though,  
I am just mist.
