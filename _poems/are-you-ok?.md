excerpt: "a funny feeling"
---

heartbreak is a funny feeling.  
i think people write about it because it’s one of those where you say,  
*it only hurts because there was so much love here.*  

it’s my favorite kind of feeling.  
if you read my work,  
they’re all over.  

i love those ones where you say,  
*it’s so big in so many directions!*  
and there’s nothing to do but be with it.  

he made me better at being with these kinds of feelings.  
and,  
he made me feel a lot of them.  

it’s love,  
i think,  
to know yourself more through someone.  

he told me we learned a lot.  
he told me it wasn’t my fault.  
he told me a lot of things i guess he could only say once it was over.  

for a long time, i whispered to myself,  
*it will be worth it on the other side,*  
and i’m only here just barely,  

but  
it  
is.  

you don’t know how i long i waited to hear him say,  
*you should keep writing songs* and  
*you’re a good person.*  

it means a lot,  
coming from him.  
he’s a good person, too.  

i could go on all night.  
it’s one of those feelings i have to love  
because it just feels  

like life.
