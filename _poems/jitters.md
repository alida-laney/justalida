excerpt: "I'm writing this poem..."
---

Buzzing around inside my body  
Are a thousand little beetles.  

I am simultaneously completely fine  
And deeply uncomfortable.  

It’s remnants of a nervous system  
Built to remain calm while on fire.  

I know this feeling well;  
It’s less frequent than it used to be.  

There’s never anywhere good to put the energy, though.  
Instead, I usually talk until I’m exhausted.  

When that’s not an option?  
I numb with social media.  

I’m writing this poem...
