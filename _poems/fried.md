excerpt: "I feel like a pinched nerve"
---

I feel like a pinched nerve, or  
An inflamed tastebud.  

So many direction changes,  
In such a short time, and  
So much expansion,  
Against my trained smallness.  

Of course I am left,  
Raw and alerting too often.  

I am tired.  
I am trusting people to carry me to the other side.  
Maybe, once I’m there,  
I will be angry.
