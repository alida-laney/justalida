excerpt: "I have never been a jewelry person."
---

I found a never-worn piece of jewelry  
Inside a box of abandoned childhood belongings.  
It was tucked away in its own box,  
Branded with the logo of the now-extinct department store  
From whence it came…  

I have never been a jewelry person.  
When I was younger, it was because it was a signifier of ‘woman,’  
And I wanted to be anything but.  
Later, it was resentment from all the pieces purchased  
Against my wishes.  

This petite silver necklace sat in the Russian-doll boxes  
For who knows how long.  
I tried it on.  
I rather liked the way it looked.  
I tried to rip the tag off, thinking it was a little paper thing.  

The unforgiving plastic tag  
Warped the metal.  

Waves of injustice poured through my body, my torso,  
Like an unexpected tsunami.  

*If I had worn the jewelry sooner, I would’ve already learned this lesson.*  
*I’m not meant for these nice things.*  
*You stupid girl, you ought to know better.*  

I put the necklace on anyway.  
I traced over the slightly warped section,  
Hoping the love and agitation from my fingers could undo the  
negligent damage done.  
In my heart, I vowed to learn from this,  
To take it as a lesson that reckless motion can cause permanent disruption.  

If you saw the necklace on me,  
You’d never notice.  

I fear it is all I’ll ever see.  

I will trace my regretful fingers across the wounded section over and over,  
Fidgeting with the damage,  
Making it worse,  
Until, one day,  
It breaks.  
And then, I’ll think,  
*Serves me right,*  
*It’s all my fault.*  
*It’s always all my fault.*
