excerpt: "It's a highlight moment"
---

It’s a highlight moment,  
The kind they say instagram feeds are made of, only,  
You couldn’t take a photo of this feeling.  

I’m hesitant, even, to write about it;  
So far, I’ve kept them mostly for myself.  
It’s not possible to bottle this up.  

It’s possible to try, though.  

Right now feels like gaining speed after painful stop and go traffic,  
Like finally stepping off the jet bridge after a twelve hour flight.  

There is journey yet to go,  
Of course,  
But dammit it feels good to be moving again.
