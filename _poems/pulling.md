excerpt: "I am learning a lot"
---

I am in a theater class  
Standing in between  
One person beckoning me with a rage-laced kindness  
And another begging me, happily.  

I am a child again.  

I fail to stand in the middle;  
I am pulled towards the begging.  

The professor says,  
*Good!*  
*You see,  
In life,  
We have these moments  
Where we choose one or the other.*  

*The one we leave behind,  
That space in between us,  
That is called Regret.*  

I cry in a dressing room,  
Feeling the pull of  
Past  
And present.  

When I return to the class,  
I am asked if I’m okay.  

Sure,  
Yeah.  

I am learning a lot  
About Theater.
