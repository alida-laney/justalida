excerpt: "Don't trauma dump."
---

Keep your personal life out of work.  

Move on from what happened.  

Work on healing!  

Why is your trauma all you talk about?  

Don’t depend on any one person too much.  

Poor baby, how’d you ever make it out?  

You’re so brave.  

We understand you’ve been going through something, but you need to make your 40 hours.  

Don’t trauma dump.  

Talk about what happened to you!  

You’re weak for crying.  

You shouldn’t have to be so strong.  

Yuck.
