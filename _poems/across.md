excerpt: "I crumpled through the threshold"
---

I crumpled through the threshold,  
Onto my knees and then to a ball on the floor.  

Deep, convulsing breaths,  
Too raw, even, to look around.  

A warm hand touched my back,  
*I’m proud of you.*  

I felt a steady grip on my arm,  
*You are so strong.*  

Before I could even regulate my breathing,  
Hands. Everywhere.  

They pulled me to standing.  
*You are incredible.*  

Twenty-seven years into this life, and  
The threshold, finally, took me home.
