Years, endless years  
Of whispering to myself,  
Curled into a ball,  
Laying in the dark,  
Gently, softly cupping  
The left side of my face with my right hand,  
Tracing my thumb over my cheekbone,  
*You can do it, Lida,*  
*Deep breaths.*   

Years of looking around, frustrated,  
Stomping my feet, thinking,  
*Why doesn’t anyone know I have something to say?!*  
Then grimacing, and replying,  
*Maybe ‘cause you haven’t said anything, you donkey.*  

I’m saying things, or  
I have a place to say things  
(I’ve been saying them for a while, now,  
Mostly because of that voice who called me a donkey).  

I just  
Feel  
So  
Big.  

I don’t care if it’s, what, six people?  
It’s more than me,  
Finally!   
It’s more than just me.  

Thank you.
