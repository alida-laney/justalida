excerpt: "Falling like a cinderblock"
---

I didn’t realize I was falling like a cinderblock  
Until I hit the concrete and  
Didn’t bounce.  

The deep thud  
Reverberates up through my knees,  
Into my hips and chest.  

The static-y upper frequencies  
Riding on the edge of that solid sound,  
Hit my ears like a dog whistle.  

My head swims through seasick waves.  
There’s an ache trying to pull me to the floor.  
I am standing,  

Solid.
