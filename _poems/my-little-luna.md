My little Luna  
Presents her head to me,  
Ears back, eyes closed,  
Expecting a little scratch.  

My little Luna  
Gets that little scratch  
Because she is so loved  
And so deserving.  

My little Luna  
Is a shining light in my life.  
She has loved me at my worst,  
Always finding me deserving.
