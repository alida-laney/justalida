excerpt: "Raw. Unfiltered."
---

Raw,  
Unfiltered.  

For some reason,  
I am embarrassed by it,  
But  
It reminds me I am safe.  

I am at home,  
Surrounded by friends.  
I am held,  
Loved by these people.  

For the first time,  
I don’t pity myself.  
I see it’s not my fault  
That I have never been able to feel this.  

There is no room for shame here.  
I am loved like never before,  
With faith and knowledge I will never, ever  
Not be loved again.  

May this love continue to find me.  
Thank you, and Amen.
