excerpt: "there are no more decisions to be made"
---

*there are no more decisions to be made*  
said one of the voices  
two days ago.  

today the voices tell me  
everything is up to me  
and my choices.  

somehow,  
they are both  
correct.  
=  
when i think of all the possibilities  
sprawled out in front of me,  
i am mystified.  

i have always been inclined to imagine,  
though i have not allowed it much  
in my recent days.  

if i do, for a moment,  
allow the imagination,  
i see so many unbelievable universes.  

the thing is,  
i’ve believed the unbelievable before  
and seen it happen.  

there are universes i won’t explore  
by conscious choice.  

i wonder if i have miscalculated.  

i have wondered this before.  

hm.
