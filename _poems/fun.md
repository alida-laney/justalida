excerpt: "Write because it's fun."
---

I saw an internet video of an artist saying,  
“Write because it’s fun.”  

And I wondered if I was getting it wrong.  
I wondered if I know what fun is.  

There was a time,  
When I was young,  
That I told stories for fun.  

Today, I write out of necessity.  
My soul is booming with the need for release.  

I write to satisfy that desire,  
not for something as trivial as fun.  

Maybe I am boring.
