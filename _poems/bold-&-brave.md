excerpt: "I am boldly and bravely frustrated"
---

I am boldly and bravely frustrated  
By this mission I am on in my life.  

At every turn,  
People are asking me to know where I am going,  
But  
I am exploring something unseen.  

When you are uncovering the mysteries of the universe,  
You, by definition, cannot know what it is you are searching for.  

My intuition does not call out to me, like a faint angelic voice in the distance,  
It rises like stomach acid and bile.  
It churns and revolts, not just begging, but demanding to be released.  

I am sickened by this pursuit,  
Yet,  
Like a truly necessary vomit,  
I know I will feel better when it has happened  
And I have settled  
On the other side.
