excerpt: "I feel so good about this one..."
---

I feel so good about this one,  
I’m afraid to say it out loud.  

I have an endless vocabulary for heartache, yet  
I lack the words for this  
simple  
feeling.  

My soul removes itself from my body  
As I try to lean into the happiness.  

It is so unfamiliar to me, and  
I am so accustomed to it’s scarcity,  
Abundance feels  
Like a trap.  

I distract myself with memories  
Of all-consuming darkness.  

Misery feels like a weighted blanket,  
At times.  
Heavy  
And cozy.  

Joy feels like springtime;  
Those weeks when things change so rapidly  

From cool brown to vibrant green,  
Begging us to forget our hardships and  
Embrace  
Newness.  

Reluctance to come alive again  
Means staying dead,  

And, philosophically,  
I am against the waste of a life.  
So I will not spend mine  
Decaying.  

I will fill my lungs with this fresh springtime air, and  
I will live again.
