You found this.
That means you were paying attention.

The question the poem asks—
*What is it to be safe?*—
doesn't have a simple answer.

Safety as a child looked like:
Staying small
Staying quiet
Staying invisible

Safety as an adult looks different:
Being seen
Being heard
Being wholly, messily human

The shift between these two definitions
is where the healing happens.
It's also where it hurts the most.

Because to feel safe *now*
I have to risk everything
that kept me safe *then*.

*If you're reading this, you're probably someone who understands that safety isn't the absence of danger. It's the presence of something else entirely—trust, perhaps. Or choice. Or the revolutionary act of believing you deserve to take up space.*
