In the space between  
what was and what might be,  
I learned to breathe underwater.  

Not the drowning kind of breathâ€”  
the kind that discovers  
lungs were meant for more  
than just surviving.  

Here, in the deep places  
where light bends strange  
and pressure builds character,  
I found the pearl  
I didn't know I'd lost.  

Turns out courage  
isn't the absence of drowningâ€”  
it's choosing to dive deeper  
when the surface  
stops being enough.
