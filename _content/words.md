When I was a child,  
Words were my refuge.  
Words on a page, in my head, or, rarely, whispered aloud  
Kept me safe.  

The thing about words  
Is how absolutely concrete  
And utterly subjective  
The experience of a word can be  

Safe  
What is it to be safe?  
It is to feel secure in your surroundings  
It is to be free from harm  

Is that, then, really what the words did?  
Were they keeping me safe?  
Or were they merely providing a shelter  
For the danger I had around me?  

Danger  
Harm  
How dangerous are things, really, if they don't kill you?  
Are those things perhaps the most harmful of all?  

What is it to be safe in a moment,  
As a child,  
If the feeling of safety  
Fails to bleed into adulthood?  

Feeling  
What is it to feel?  
Truly and genuinely,  
I am not sure I've ever felt before  

I was never safe to feel  
I was never free from danger  
I stored my harm inside words and locked them away  
Thinking the words would hold that feeling forever  

But, as it turns out,  
Forever is just a word, too
