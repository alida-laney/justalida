*[This would be where you'd describe or embed the visual artwork]*

This digital piece was created as a visual response to the poem "Words" - exploring how language can both shelter and contain our experiences. The layered imagery reflects the complex relationship between protection and imprisonment that words can create.

The piece uses overlapping text fragments, blurred and distorted, to represent how memories and meanings shift over time. Colors transition from darker, enclosed spaces to areas of emerging light.

**Artist's Note:** 
This piece emerged from sitting with the poem "Words" and feeling the weight of how language shapes our understanding of safety and danger. The visual interpretation attempts to capture what words cannot fully express about the embodied experience of trauma and recovery.
