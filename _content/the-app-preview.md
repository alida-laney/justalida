## What It Is

A passion project born from personal experience and technical curiosity. This app sits at the intersection of healing and technology, designed to support people navigating complex emotional and spiritual terrain.

## The Vision

Sometimes the tools we need for healing don't exist yet. Sometimes we have to build them ourselves. This app is my attempt to create something that could have helped me during my own journey—and might help others on theirs.

## Technical Approach

- **Built with**: Modern web technologies (specifics to be revealed)
- **Focus**: Privacy-first, user-controlled data
- **Design philosophy**: Evidence-based functionality meets intuitive experience
- **Architecture**: Scalable, but designed for genuine connection over growth metrics

## Current Status

*In active development*

The core functionality is taking shape, and early testing has been promising. I'm taking my time to get the fundamentals right—both technically and ethically.

## Why Share This Now?

Because building in isolation can be both powerful and limiting. If you're curious about the intersection of healing and technology, or if you're working on similar challenges, I'd love to hear from you.

**Development Philosophy:**
"Technology should serve human flourishing, not exploit human vulnerability."
